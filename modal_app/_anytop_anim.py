"""Modal app: AnyTop (MIT, SIGGRAPH 2025) animation
generation, exposed via the same async spawn-poll-stream pattern as
the Puppeteer rig router.

Independent app `myfabmesh-anim`: AnyTop requires Python 3.8 + torch
2.4.1 which conflicts with the rig stack (Python 3.11 + torch 2.7).
Trying to share an image would force one or the other to break.

Endpoints exposed by `anim_router` ASGI app:
  POST /anim-start         — spawn animate_mesh() ; persists call_id
  POST /anim-status        — reload volume ; report ready/error
  POST /anim-fetch         — stream the animated GLB
  GET  /healthz            — liveness probe

Each call writes:
  /anim_data/<job_id>.glb   on success
  /anim_data/<job_id>.err   on failure (JSON with error string)
  /anim_data/<job_id>.call_id — FunctionCall object_id for cancellation

Mirrors `modal_app/_puppeteer_rig.py` 1:1 in structure; only the GPU
work inside `animate_mesh()` differs.
