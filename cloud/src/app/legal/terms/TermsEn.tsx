// Terms of Service — ENGLISH version (2026-09-28).
// Rebuilt from the English text that preceded the French translation
// (commit 2b2bc56), then brought level with the French changes made since:
// ODR platform removed (10a), marketplace refunds rewritten around the
// right of withdrawal (11.2). TermsFr.tsx holds the French text, which is the
// one enforceable against a French consumer; keep the two in step.

      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p style={{ color: 'var(--text-2)' }}>Last updated: 2026-06-20</p>

      <p>
        By creating an account on {id.tradeName} (operated by{' '}
        <strong>{id.operator}</strong>, {id.country}), you accept these terms.
        If you don&apos;t accept them, don&apos;t create an account.
        Contact: <a href={`mailto:${id.supportEmail}`}>{id.supportEmail}</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>1. The service</h2>
      <p>
        MyFabmesh.AI lets you generate images and 3D meshes via AI models
        running on third-party GPU infrastructure (Modal Labs, Replicate).
        You pay with prepaid credits or a monthly subscription, both
        processed by Stripe.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Your account</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 16 years old (or the legal age of digital consent in your country).</li>
        <li>One account per person. No account sharing.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for keeping your password secret. We&apos;ll never ask you for it.</li>
        <li>Suspicious activity (brute-force, credential sharing, automated scraping) is grounds for immediate suspension.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Credits and subscriptions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>One-shot credit packs (Starter / Pro / Studio) never expire.</li>
        <li>Monthly subscriptions auto-renew until you cancel them. To cancel, e-mail{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${id.supportEmail}`}>{id.supportEmail}</a> — the renewal is
          stopped within one business day and no further charge is made. Credits from a
          subscription month do not roll over.</li>
        <li>Refunds: prepaid credits are non-refundable once they have been spent. Unspent credits are refundable within 14 days of purchase for EU buyers (right of withdrawal — Code de la consommation Art. L221-18 et seq.), unless you have already started consuming them.</li>
        <li>Pricing is shown on <a href="/buy">/buy</a> and can change with 30 days&apos; notice. Prior purchases keep their original credit values.</li>
        <li>All consumer prices are shown <strong>inclusive of tax (TTC)</strong>. Any applicable VAT is included and computed according to your country of residence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3a. Right of withdrawal &amp; digital content (EU consumers)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Principle.</strong> As an EU consumer you normally have 14 days to
          withdraw from a distance purchase without giving a reason (Code de la
          consommation Art. L221-18 et seq.). Unspent, unused credits are refundable
          within that period.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Waiver for immediately-supplied digital content
          (Art. L221-28 13°).</strong> Credits are digital content usable
          immediately, and generated assets are digital content supplied on a
          non-tangible medium as soon as you launch a generation. By purchasing and
          by ticking the consent box at checkout, you{' '}
          <strong>expressly request that performance begin immediately</strong> and
          you <strong>acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal</strong>{' '}
          in respect of any credit you have started to consume and of any asset
          already generated (Art. L221-28 13° of the Code de la consommation).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What remains refundable.</strong> Credits that you have neither
          spent nor started to consume remain refundable within the 14-day period.
        </li>
        {/* COMMENT EXERCER LE DROIT — l'article L221-18 et suivants impose de
            donner les modalites, pas seulement le principe. La section
            annoncait le droit et sa renonciation sans jamais dire par quel
            canal l'exercer, a partir de quand courent les 14 jours, ni sous
            quel delai le remboursement intervient. */}
        <li>
          <strong>How to withdraw.</strong> Send us any unambiguous statement of
          your decision — an e-mail to{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${id.supportEmail}`}>{id.supportEmail}</a> is enough,
          and you may also write to {id.registeredOffice}. You can use the model
          withdrawal form below, but you are not required to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>When the 14 days start.</strong> For a supply of digital
          content, the period runs from the <strong>day the contract is
          concluded</strong> — that is, the day of your purchase — not from a
          delivery date (Art. L221-18, 1°).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>When you are refunded.</strong> At the latest{' '}
          <strong>14 days after we receive your decision</strong>, using the same
          payment method you used, at no cost to you (Art. L221-24).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Model withdrawal form</h3>
      <p style={{ color: 'var(--text-2)', fontSize: 13 }}>
        Complete and return this form only if you wish to withdraw from the
        contract. Copying the text into an e-mail is sufficient.
      </p>
      <pre style={{
        whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', padding: '14px 16px', borderRadius: 8,
        border: '1px solid var(--border, #333)', fontSize: 13, lineHeight: 1.6,
      }}>{`To ${id.operator} — ${id.registeredOffice} — ${id.supportEmail}

I/We (*) hereby give notice that I/We (*) withdraw from my/our (*) contract of

      <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generate, upload or share illegal content — notably CSAM, content that infringes other people&apos;s rights, or anything else prohibited by French law.</li>
        <li>Attempt to bypass quotas, rate-limits, NSFW filters or any other safety mechanism.</li>
        <li>Probe the infrastructure for vulnerabilities without our written authorization (see <em>Responsible disclosure</em> below).</li>
        <li>Resell access to your account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Intellectual property</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What you upload</strong> belongs to you. You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to store it, route it to GPU providers, and process it on your behalf — strictly to provide the service. We don&apos;t train models on your inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>What you generate</strong> is yours under the licence the underlying models allow. The AI models we use all currently permit commercial use of their outputs. You can use the outputs commercially. We claim no rights on them.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-generated content &amp; transparency.</strong> All images and 3D assets produced by the service are generated by artificial intelligence. In line with the EU AI Act (Art. 50), generated images are marked with machine-readable provenance metadata (IPTC <code>DigitalSourceType=trainedAlgorithmicMedia</code>). If you generate the likeness of a real, identifiable person, you are solely responsible for holding the necessary rights and for any disclosure obligations applicable to such content.</li>
        <li><strong>Our brand, code and UI</strong> are ours. You can&apos;t copy them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Service availability</h2>
      <p>
        We aim for high availability but don&apos;t promise 24/7 uptime.
        Generations can fail; when that happens we refund the credits
        automatically. We may suspend the service at any time for
        maintenance, security incidents, or to enforce these terms — see
        the admin kill switches in our privacy / security model.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Termination</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can delete your account at any time in the app: <a href="/app/?reglages=compte">Settings (⚙) → Privacy &amp; data</a>. All your data is wiped within seconds.</li>
        <li>We can suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms or pose a security/legal risk. Unused credits on a terminated account are refunded except when the termination is for fraud or abuse.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent allowed by French law: the service is
        provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo;. We&apos;re not liable for indirect
        damages (lost profits, lost data, missed opportunities). Our total
        liability over a 12-month period is capped at the total amount
        you paid us during that period.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Responsible disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        If you find a security vulnerability, please email{' '}
        <a href={`mailto:${id.supportEmail}`}>{id.supportEmail}</a>{' '}
        with the details. We&apos;ll acknowledge within 48 hours, work with
        you on a fix, and credit you on a public thank-you page if you
        want. Don&apos;t exploit, don&apos;t exfiltrate other users&apos; data,
        don&apos;t publish before the fix is live.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by French law. Any dispute that
        can&apos;t be resolved amicably falls under the jurisdiction of
        the French courts.
      </p>

      <h2>10a. Consumer mediation (Médiateur de la consommation)</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with Article L612-1 of the French Consumer Code, after
        first sending us a written complaint, any consumer may refer the dispute
        free of charge to the designated consumer mediator:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Designated consumer mediator:</strong> {id.mediator.name} — {id.mediator.postalAddress} — <a href={id.mediator.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener">{id.mediator.url}</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        {/* The European Commission's ODR platform was ABOLISHED by Regulation
            (EU) 2024/3228 and has handled no complaint since 20 July 2025 (see
            TermsFr.tsx) : pointing to it sent the consumer to a dead address. */}
        Mediation is optional and free of charge for the consumer; it does not
        take away the right to bring the matter before the competent courts. A
        written complaint must first have been sent to our customer support.
        The full mediator coordinates are also listed in the{' '}
        <a href="/legal/mentions">Legal Notice (Mentions légales)</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Marketplace</h2>

      <h3>11.1 Publishing assets</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Users may publish meshes and images they generated on the platform to the Marketplace.</li>
        <li>Each listing is reviewed by an administrator before becoming visible to buyers.</li>
        <li>The author retains ownership of their creation; publishing grants the platform a non-exclusive right to display the asset and process sales.</li>
        <li>Authors guarantee that their submission does not infringe any third-party rights.</li>
        <li>Authors can choose between five licences (Personal use, CC0, CC-BY 4.0, CC-BY-NC 4.0, Royalty-free commercial). The licence is attached to the asset on download.</li>
        <li>An administrator may at any time reject or remove a listing that breaches these terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11.2 Buying assets</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Free listings are downloadable immediately by any signed-in user after approval.</li>
        <li>Paid listings are bought via Stripe Checkout. Buyers receive a non-exclusive licence under the terms attached to the asset.</li>
        <li>Buyers may NOT redistribute, resell, or sublicense purchased assets unless the chosen licence (CC0, CC-BY, commercial) explicitly allows it.</li>
        {/* Same rewrite as TermsFr.tsx (11.2): the law forbids asking for a
            reason or leaving the refund to our discretion during the
            withdrawal period; the only limit is the Art. L221-28 13° waiver. */}
        <li>
          <strong>Right of withdrawal.</strong> As an EU consumer, you have 14
          days from the purchase to withdraw, <strong>without giving any reason
          and at no cost</strong> (Code de la consommation Art. L221-18 et seq.).
          No reason will be asked of you and the refund is not subject to any
          assessment on our part.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Waiver in case of immediate download
          (Art. L221-28 13°).</strong> A purchased asset is digital content
          supplied on a non-tangible medium and downloadable right after
          payment. When you confirm your order, you are asked to tick a box by
          which you expressly request that supply begin immediately and
          acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal. Only{' '}
          <strong>after this double consent and once the asset has been
          downloaded</strong> is the right of withdrawal extinguished for that
          purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What remains refundable.</strong> As long as you have not
          downloaded the purchased asset, you are refunded on simple request
          within the 14 days. The same applies if the waiver box was not
          collected, and in cases of non-conformity (corrupted file, asset not
          matching the listing, licence different from the one displayed),
          which fall under the legal guarantee of conformity and do not depend
          on the 14-day period.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How to request a refund.</strong> E-mail us at{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${id.supportEmail}`}>{id.supportEmail}</a> &mdash; an
          unambiguous statement is enough, and the model form in section 3a may
          be used but is not required. You are refunded at the latest{' '}
          <strong>14 days after we receive your decision</strong>, by the same
          payment method, at no cost (Art. L221-24).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11.3 Commission and payouts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The platform takes a 30% commission on every paid sale. The seller receives 70% net.</li>
        <li>Sellers can opt to receive their share either as platform credits (instant, +20% bonus over cash equivalent) or as cash via Stripe Connect (after KYC onboarding handled by Stripe).</li>
        <li>Cash payouts are settled by Stripe directly to the seller&apos;s linked bank account on the Stripe payout schedule.</li>
        <li>Sellers using Stripe Connect agree to Stripe&apos;s <a href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal">Connected Account Agreement</a>.</li>
        <li>The platform is not responsible for delays caused by Stripe verification, banking holidays, or KYC issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11.4 Taxes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sellers are responsible for declaring and paying any taxes (VAT, income tax) due in their jurisdiction on their marketplace earnings.</li>
        <li>The platform may report seller activity to tax authorities where required (US 1099-K reporting via Stripe above the IRS threshold; EU DAC7 above the EUR 2000 / 30-sales annual threshold).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>11.5 Disputes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Disputes between buyer and seller (asset quality, licence interpretation) should first be brought to platform support.</li>
        <li>The platform may mediate and, if appropriate, refund the buyer or sanction the seller.</li>
        <li>Chargebacks initiated by buyers via their bank are handled by Stripe; the platform may withhold the disputed amount from the seller&apos;s pending balance until resolution.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>12. Copyright &amp; takedown (DMCA / EU)</h2>
      <p>
        We respect intellectual property and respond to valid notices of claimed
        infringement under the U.S. DMCA (17 U.S.C. §512) and the EU Copyright
        Directive / French LCEN.
      </p>
      <h3>12.1 Filing a notice</h3>
      <p>
        If you believe content on MyFabmesh.AI (a generated asset, a marketplace
        listing, or an uploaded image) infringes your copyright, email{' '}
        <a href={`mailto:${id.supportEmail}`}>{id.supportEmail}</a> with the
        subject &ldquo;Copyright notice&rdquo; and include: identification of the
        copyrighted work and of the infringing material (with a URL or listing
        ID); your contact details; a statement that you have a good-faith belief
        the use is not authorised; a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the
        information is accurate and that you are the rights holder or authorised to
        act for them; and your physical or electronic signature. We will remove or
        disable access to the reported material expeditiously and notify the
        uploader.
      </p>
      <h3>12.2 Counter-notice</h3>
      <p>
        If your content was removed and you believe this was a mistake or
        misidentification, send a counter-notice to the same address with the
        identification of the removed material, your contact details, a statement
        under penalty of perjury that the removal was a mistake, and your
        signature. We may restore the material unless the original claimant
        initiates legal action.
      </p>
      <h3>12.3 Repeat infringers</h3>
      <p>
        Accounts that repeatedly infringe third-party rights are suspended or
        terminated.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Reporting illegal content (EU Digital Services Act)</h2>
      <p>
        Under the EU Digital Services Act (Regulation 2022/2065), anyone can
        notify us of content they consider illegal.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>How to report:</strong> use the &ldquo;Report&rdquo; control on a
          marketplace listing, or email{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${id.supportEmail}`}>{id.supportEmail}</a> with
          the subject &ldquo;Illegal content&rdquo;, an explanation of why the
          content is illegal, and its location (URL or listing ID).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Point of contact:</strong> the address above is our single point
          of contact for users and authorities (DSA Art. 11–12).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Our action:</strong> we review every notice, remove or disable
          content that is illegal or breaches these terms, and inform the affected
          user with a <em>statement of reasons</em> (DSA Art. 17).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Appeal:</strong> if your content or account is restricted, you
          may contest the decision by replying to the statement of reasons; a
          human re-examines the case.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Illegal content is never allowed</strong> — in particular CSAM,
          terrorist content, and content infringing others&apos; rights. We
          cooperate with the competent authorities and report offences where the
          law requires it.
